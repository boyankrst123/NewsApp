# NewsApp

This is a simple React Native App that displays 10 random articles via HackerNews API

First, clone the repository : 
- git clone https://github.com/boyankrst123/NewsApp.git

Second, go to the downloaded folder "NewsApp" and do : 
- npm install 
- npm start

When the metro server is started you can open the 'android' folder in Android Studio and run the simulator.

This is a one screen app that will open with loading animation until 10 articles are loaded.
Clicking on a single news article will navigate the user to the designated URL.

Currently styling of the app is minimal. 
In order to progress this app further and have a fantastic design and visual effects - more time on this task is needed.
